COMMENT ON PROCEDURE minesweeper.updateGame(IN INTEGER, IN minesweeper.GameStatus, IN INTEGER[][]) IS $$Updates a game
to a new status and board.

It assumes that preconditions are accomplished (the game exists, it is not transitioning to `PAUSED` status -see
pauseGame for that-, and is not in WON or LOOSE status).

#### Parameters
1. `gameId`: unique identifier of the game to pause.
2. `gameStatus`: status to which the game is transitioning.
3. `gameBoard`: definition of the desired game cells board.
